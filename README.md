# MongoDB updateOne - Missing Modified Count Check

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `updateOne` method in MongoDB's Node.js driver.  The provided code lacks proper error handling, specifically concerning situations where no documents are modified by `updateOne`.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version, including a check for the `modifiedCount` property to handle cases where no documents match the update criteria.

## How to reproduce

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and have the necessary Node.js and MongoDB driver dependencies installed (`npm install mongodb`).
3.  Configure the `uri` variable in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` with your MongoDB connection string.
4.  Run `node bug.js` to see the original, problematic behavior.
5.  Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved, error-handled version.

## Solution

Always check the `modifiedCount` property of the result returned by `updateOne`.  If `modifiedCount` is 0, no documents were updated.  Handle this case appropriately within your application logic to avoid potential unexpected behavior.
